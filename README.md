# Public IOS Projects

Having learnt the basics of Swift recently, I aim to expand on my learning and dive into more advanced IOS app development. Here is a collection of applications I am working on.



### 1. Oven Timer
----

I have always had a huge (irrational) fear of undercooking food. I don't like 'guestimating' how long food should be cooked for when put in with other items.
So I created this small app (not completed yet) that lets you input the name, cooking time, and cooking temperature (from packaging) of various food items you want to cook, and then using this data the app produces instructions detailing exactly what temperature to heat the oven to, and when to put each item in.
